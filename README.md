# HearAI
Model Sign Language with Machine Learning.

Deaf people are affected by many forms of exclusion, especially now in the pandemic world. [HearAI](https://www.hearai.pl/) aims to build a deep learning solution to make the world more accessible for the Deaf community and increase the existing knowledge base in using AI for Polish Sign Language.

# ü§ñ Pipeline prototype
This is a prototypical repository of the HearAI project. Be careful as the work is still in progress!

## üí° Idea

Video --> Frames --> Feature extractor --> Transformer --> Classification heads --> Prediction for video


## üß™ Feature extractors
A feature extractor is a model used to extract features directly from the input: e.g., a set of video frames. For instance, we use a CNN that extracts features from each video frame with `multi_frame_feature_extractor`. Another approach could be extracting the pose of a signer and passing the coordinates to GCN (Graph CNN), for each frame separately. 
Feature extractor returns a representation feature vector for every frame.

## üß† Transformer
The transformer is a widely-used deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in natural language processing (NLP). The Transfomer model will get representation from feature_extractor of size `num_frames,representation_size` for each video in our pipeline.

## üìë [WiP] Datasets
In our studies we are using PJM lexicon with annotations provided at our internal server at:
- directories with frames: `/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm/`
- HamNoSys annotation file: `/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm/test_hamnosys.txt` - 8 heads only [WiP]
- glosses annotation file: `/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm/test_gloss2.txt`
- landmarks directory: `/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/#mediapipe_landmarks/korpus/labeled/`

To load multiple datasets simply pass to ```args.parser``` list of datasets (file paths to video separated with spaces). We have possibility to load these datasets:
- pjm: /dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm
- basic_lexicon: /dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/basic_lexicon
- galex: /dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/galex
- glex: /dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/glex

```python
python3 train.py --data "/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm" "/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/basic_lexicon" --epochs 100 --lr 1e-4 --classification-mode "hamnosys" --neptune --num_segments 16 --b 4 --workers 0 --gpu 1
```

Attention! The method requires that all ```annotation_files``` have exactly the same annotation filename e.g. ```"test_hamnosys.txt"```! If you need to pass different path you need to do it manually.

Dataloader gives possibility to load data:
- choosing number of frames by setting `--num_segments` variable (in this option `--time` argument is set to `None` as default)
- evenly distribiuted using defined time unit by specifing `--time` argument and `--num_segments` as  number of frames in video sequence (note that in this option `--landmarks_path` has to be set to get basic information about video, eg. `fps` value)

## üë• Classification heads
Pipeline handle multihead classification. We predefine `classification_heads` for both Gloss Translation and HamNoSys recognition. Our `classification_heads` are defined here: `utils/classification_mode.py`. For each head, a custom loss weight can be provided.

Hamburg Sign Language Notation System (HamNoSys) is a gesture transcription alphabetic system that describes the symbols and gestures such as hand shape, hand location, and movement. Read more about HamNoSys [here - Introduction to HamNoSys](https://www.hearai.pl/post/4-hamnosys/) and [here - Introduction to HamNoSys Part 2](https://www.hearai.pl/post/5-hamnosys2/). HamNoSys always have the same number of possible classes.

```
        "symmetry_operator": {
            "num_class": 9,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },
        "hand_shape_base_form": {
            "num_class": 12,
            "loss_weight": 1,
        },
        "hand_shape_thumb_position": {
            "num_class": 4,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },
        "hand_shape_bending": {
            "num_class": 6,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },
        "hand_position_finger_direction": {
            "num_class": 18,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },
        "hand_position_palm_orientation": {
            "num_class": 8,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },
        "hand_location_x": {
            "num_class": 5,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },
        "hand_location_y": {
            "num_class": 37,
            "loss_weight": 0,
        },

```

Gloss is an annotation system that applies a label (a word) to the sign. Number glosses depend on a language and dataset. It is usually a bigger number as it must define as many words (glosses) as possible.

```
"gloss": {
                "num_class": 2400,
                "loss_weight": 1
            }
```

# üõ† Environment setup

To create a reproducible environment, create a virtual environment using venv and requirements defined.
In terminal run:
`make venv`

When you install a new library, please add it to the list in `requirements.txt` file so we can avoid dependency conflicts or failed build.

# üèÅ Example train.py run

Run with a single dataset:

`python3 train.py --data "/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm" --epochs 100 --lr 1e-4 --classification-mode "hamnosys" --neptune --num_segments 16 --b 4 --workers 16 --gpu 1`

Run with multiple datasets (list datasets paths separated with spaces)

`python3 train.py --data "/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/pjm" "/dih4/dih4_2/hearai/data/frames/basic_lexicon" --epochs 100 --lr 1e-4 --classification-mode "hamnosys" --neptune --num_segments 16 --b 4 --workers 0 --gpu 1`




# üé® Style

For style formatting, the `black` library is used as default.
If you want to check whether your code matches style requirements, in the terminal run:
`make format-check`
If you want to apply changes to your code formatting style, in the terminal run:
`make format-apply`

To check code quality with linter, in the terminal run:
`make lint`
Currently, `pylint` is the default linter with access to train.py and models/ (all files are evaluated altogether, if you want to test your specific file, try: `pylint yourfile.py`)

# ü™ê How to setup logging with neptune.ai
- go to your neptune.ai account and get your API token
- in terminal, add your personal token to environmental variables
`export NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN = "<your_token>"`
- go to your neptune.ai account and get your project name
- in terminal, add your project name to environmental variables
`export NEPTUNE_PROJECT_NAME = "<your_workspace/your_project_name>"`
- if you want to make sure that your credentials are saved properly, you can use `printenv`
- to run training with Neptune logger initialized, add `--neptune` flag, i.e. `python3 train.py --neptune`
